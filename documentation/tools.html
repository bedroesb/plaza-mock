					Tool to explore the copy-number gene family variation between two groups of species.
				</li>
				<li>
					Easily detect gene family expansions between two groups of organisms (each group contains one or more organisms).
					Thus it is easy to explore gene families with a large copy number in one phylogenetic clade compared to another phylogenetic clade.
					For each small square in the expansion plot, there is a corresponding copy number in organism group 1 (X-axis) and a corresponding copy number in organism group 2 (Y-Axis), respectively.
					The color of the square indicates how many gene families in PLAZA have those copy numbers in organism group 1 and 2 (see legend on figure).
					As such, squares with a large X-value and a low Y-value are expanded gene families in organism group 1, while squares with a large Y-Value and a low X-value represent expanded gene families in organism group 2.
					Squares situated around the diagonal can be considered not to be expanded.

					<span>Parameters:</span>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<em class="u">Maximum drawing size</em>:
							Gene families with a too large copy number in either organisms group 1 or 2, are displayed on the outer border of the Expansion Plot.
							By increasing the maximum drawing size the range of axes is increased, leading to a decreasing number of squares on the border.
						</li>
						<li>
							<em class="u">Normalize by number of selected species</em>:
							When there is more than 1 species in either organism group 1 or 2, it becomes clear that comparing gene families purely on copy number introduces a bias towards the group with more organisms.
							Therefore the gene family copy number of the organism groups can be adapted so it averages over the number of species in that group.
						</li>
						<li>
							<em class="u">Use only gene families where the selected species are all present</em>:
							If selected, only those gene families, which have a representative gene of <strong>each</strong> organism of both groups, will be displayed.
							Otherwise a single representative gene from each group will suffice to include the gene family.
							Selection of this option will result in a smaller set of gene families.
						</li>
						<li>
							<em class="u">Use only gene families specific to the selected species</em>:
							If selected, only those gene families which have <strong>only</strong> representative genes from the selected organisms, will be displayed.
							Selection of this option will result in a smaller set of gene families.

		<h3 id="gene_family_expansion_analysis">Gene family expansion analysis</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				This page provides an overview of how expanded the copy number of genes from each species are, within a gene family.
			</li>
			<li>
				Using the same approach as the <a href="https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/documentation/tools#gene_family_finder">Gene Family Finder tool</a> (Find species/clade-enriched gene families),
				this page uses the ratio of the copy number of a species (within a gene family) compared to the overall proteome size to evaluate whether an expansion for that species has occurred.
			</li>
			<li>
				This method works well for multi-copy gene families, but single-copy gene families (in which each species has only 1 ortholog) might be incorrectly interpreted, as the species with the smaller proteome size will automatically be indicated as being depleted within that gene family.
			</li>
			<li>
				Expansions are indicated with a ratio higher than 1, depletions are indicated with a ratio between 0 and 1.
				An adapted color-scheme makes it easy to compare expansions and depletions (light colors indicate minimal expansions/depletions, intense colors indicate heavy expansions/depletions).
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>This tool is accessible from each gene family page </strong>

		<h3 id="gene_family_finder">Gene family finder</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				This tool enables to identify (expanded) gene families specific to one or more species.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Gene Family Finder tool consists of two separate search functions:
				an option to find species/clade-specific gene families and an option to find species/clade-expanded gene families.
			</li>
		</ul>

			</div>
			<div style="width:65%;float:left;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The user has the ability to detect specific gene families based on phylogenetic profiles (presence or absence of a gene family in a species).
						For each species, the user can decide to include that species in the search, or to ignore it.
						<strong>It is important to make the distinction between setting the expected gene copy number for a species to zero or ignoring that species in the search.</strong>
						When the species is included, the gene copy number for that species will be evaluated. If that species is ignored, the gene copy number for that species is not evaluated.
						<ul>
							<li>
								For example: If a user wants to view only the <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> specific gene families,
								then the <em>include</em> button for all species should be selected (together with value 0),
								and only for <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> the equal sign (<em>=</em>) should be changed to the greater-than-sign (<em> &gt; </em>).
								This way, the database will know to select only these gene families for which the gene number of each species is zero,
								except for <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Clade-specific gene families can be found by manually selecting the species and their expected gene copy number,
						or by using the drop-down selection menu including pre-defined clades.
						Further options and refinements to the search are still possible at that time.
					</li>

			<h4 id="find_species_clade-enriched_gene_families">Find species/clade-enriched gene families</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					This tool allows the user to select one or more species, and find the gene families where the copy number for the selected species is higher than would be expected.
					The expansion ratio denotes, for a specific species, the fraction of genes in a gene family over the fraction of proteins (for that species) in the total PLAZA proteome.
				</li>
				<li>
					For example: the <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> proteome makes up 3.5% of the PLAZA 2.5 proteome.
					A valid search for <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> expanded gene families could be one where the <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> gene copy number makes up 35% of the gene family size.
					 In that case it could be said that said gene families are 10x enriched for <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Options include selection of the expansion ratio (compared to full proteome set), and the minimum and maximum number of genes in the gene families.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Both tools can be found at <em>Analyze → Gene Family Finder</em> or from a species (or phylogenetic clade) page</strong>

				</li>
				<li>
					Starting from a query locus, the Skyline plot gives an overview of the colinear regions that exist within a set of selected species, i.e. regions between the selected species which have conserved gene content and order.
					This region is selected using a reference gene that should always be entered.
					Selection of only the organism for which the query locus was entered will provide an overview of the duplicated blocks overlapping with the query locus, while selecting other species as well will report all colinear regions.
					The plot will find all multiplicons that match the reference chromosome, and will check for each organism how many segments can be found together with the reference segments in one multiplicon.
					Each block is clickable and will take you to the multiplicon view.
				</li>
				<li>
					This plot can thus be used to study the number of identifiable duplications in the evolutionary history of organisms.
					The example Skyline Plot image for example details a maximum of six colinear poplar segments versus three Arabidopsis thaliana segments.
					When studying the Skyline plots on a per-chromosome basis between species the number of duplication events can as such be measured.
				</li>
				<li>
					Advanced options include the window size and the experiment (i.e. i-ADHoRe settings and selected species to identify gene colinearity).
					The window size makes it possible to report colinearity for only a small region around the query locus (50, 100, 200 or 500 genes) or for the entire chromosome (chromosome).
					The experiment selection makes it possible to use the output of specific i-ADHoRe runs (i.e. the method used to detect gene colinearity).

				<li>
					 Note that different segments in the same stack (i.e. on top of each other) can point to different multiplicons (from different species).

					For a selected gene set it might be relevant to know if these genes have a related function or are involved in a specific biological process.
					This analysis can be done for the genes in your workbench using the GO enrichment tool.
					This tool will compare the occurrence of a certain GO label in a gene set (~workbench experiment) with the occurrence in the genome.
					The significance of over- or under-representation is determined using the hypergeometric distribution and the Bonferroni method is applied to correct for multiple testing.
					Note that enrichment folds are reported in <strong>log2 scale</strong> (e.g. value = 1 is two-fold enriched; value = -1 is two-fold depleted); in order to have the non-transformed enrichment/depletion values, use the power-operation (e.g. 2^1=2 : two fold enrichment; 2^-1=0.5 : two fold depletion).

			<h4 id="using_the_plaza_integrative_method">Using the PLAZA integrative orthology method</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Retrieval of orthologous genes through the <a href="https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/documentation/data_content#orthologous_genes">PLAZA integrative method</a> provides a comprehensive way of finding, for a set of genes, orthologous genes in another species.
					The integrative method combines multiple methods (evidence types) to predict orthology.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>These basics need to be taken when searching for orthologous genes:</span>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Select the <strong>source species</strong>. This list is limited by the genes present in the workbench experiment gene set.
						</li>
						<li>
							Select the <strong>target species</strong>. Orthologous relationships are defined as being between 2 species.
						</li>
						<li>
							Select the appropriate <strong>orthologous relationship(s)</strong>.
							When a gene has no paralogs and only 1 ortholog, this is a 1-1 orthologous relationship.
							This type of relationship is highly advantageous for the transfer of functional assessments between different species.
							Similarly, when a gene has 1 or more paralog(s) and only 1 ortholog, this is an N-1 orthologous relationship (N is implied to be larger than 1).
							Considering different scenario's, this leads to four different orthology relationship types: 1-1, N-1, 1-N, M-N. Selection of one or more of these types will result in the corresponding types of orthology relationships to be included in the output.
						</li>
						<li>
							Select the accepted <strong>evidence types</strong>.
							The PLAZA integrative method is based on the combination of different <a href="https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/documentation/data_content#orthologous_genes">methods</a> for orthology detection.
							Selection of these evidence types will result in the corresponding genes to be accepted as orthologs.
							When an evidence type is not selected, then data associated with this evidence will simply be ignored.
						</li>
						<li>
							Select the <strong>minimum number of evidence types</strong> which are required for an orthologous relationship to be acknowledged.
							This number will also be used to determine the paralogous relationships (which are needed to determine what kind of orthology types are present).
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>For example, say gene A1 is orthologous with gene B1 and gene B2. </span>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The supporting evidence types for the A1-B1 orthologous relationship are a)<em>Colinearity</em> b)<em>Orthologous gene family</em> c)<em>Best-Hits-and-Inparalogs (BHI)</em>.
						</li>
						<li>
							The supporting evidence types for the A1-B2 orthologous relationship are a)<em>Orthologous gene family</em> b)<em>Phylogenetic tree inference</em>.
						</li>
						<li>
							With the standard settings (all orthologous relationship types allowed, all evidence types taken into account, minimum number of required evidence is 1), then the result would be a 1-N (1-2 actually) orthology relationship between A1 and B1,B2.
							However, it is clear that B1 has more supporting evidence than B2, for their relationship with A1.
							Therefore, when putting the minimum required evidence types at 3, the A1-B2 relationship will not be taken into account, and a 1-1 orthology relationship between A1-B1 will be the result.
